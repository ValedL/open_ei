#TRACE

#DESCRIPTION
The error is a high CPU consumption by a particular Elixir Process, specifically the process with PID<0.1669.0>. This process is repeatedly executing the function calc_sum/3, part of the OpenElixirIntelligence.ExampleSystem.Math module. The issue lies with the recursive logic of calc_sum/3 function, which doesn't seem to have a proper base case causing an infinite recursion.
#DESCRIPTION

#TIMESTAMP
May 5, 2024 03:11:44.300 GMT
#TIMESTAMP

#POSSIBLE_ISSUES
1. Inappropriate recursive pattern which leads to infinite recursion.
2. calc_sum/3 function does not handle negative values correctly. It seems that the second argument is -1 which might be causing an infinite loop as the function is designed to increment the from parameter until it equals the to parameter.
#POSSIBLE_ISSUES

#POSSIBLE_SOLUTIONS
1. Implement an appropriate base case for the recursion in calc_sum/3 function.
2. Handle negative values correctly in calc_sum/3 function to prevent infinite recursion.
3. Implement error handling measures to alert when high CPU usage is detected.
#POSSIBLE_SOLUTIONS

#BEST_SOLUTION
The best solution is to handle the negative values correctly in calc_sum/3 function to prevent infinite recursion. The base case for the recursion assumes that the "from" value will eventually equal "to". However, when "to" is negative, the recursive case keeps incrementing "from" indefinitely. The solution is to refactor the recursion to account for negative inputs.
#BEST_SOLUTION

#TEST
To test the solution, you would need to input negative numbers into the sum/1 function and ensure it doesn't result in high CPU usage and the function returns the correct output.

#DESCRIPTION
The provided solution corrects the recursive calc_sum/3 function to properly handle cases when "from" is larger than "to". This prevents infinite recursion and the high CPU usage previously encountered. Now, when sum/1 function is called with a number, it correctly calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to the given number. The solution is efficient and elegant, maintaining the recursive aspect of the original code but adding a necessary condition to prevent potential issues.

Review and then fix following the below guidelines:
1. Expose the fixed logic as a public function that can be tested from outside the module
2. Make sure the public function can be executed without OTP, task async, agent, etc from iex
3. It shall be possible to hotreload the original code and it should work
4. Don't forget that laguage is Elixir
5. All errors should be handled gracefully (ie no raising exceptions, etc.)

Sure, let's address the issues you listed. The calc_sum/3 function appears to be a recursive addition function, from "from" to "to". Right now, the from variable keeps incrementing until it is no longer less than to, but as you mentioned, if to is less than from to start with, this would cause an infinite recursion.

We'll add a clause to the calc_sum/3 function to handle the case when the from variable is higher than the to variable. Here's the fixed version of the code:

#CODE
defmodule LlmEvaluator.MyMath do
def sum(number) when is_integer(number), do: calc_sum(1, number, 0)

defp calc_sum(from, to, acc_sum) when from > to, do: acc_sum
defp calc_sum(from, from, sum), do: sum + from
defp calc_sum(from, to, acc_sum), do: calc_sum(from + 1, to, acc_sum + from)
end
#CODE

You can test this function by giving it a number and checking if it returns the correct sum.

#EXAMPLE
number = 10
sum = LlmEvaluator.MyMath.sum(number)
IO.inspect(sum)
#EXAMPLE

It should return the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10.

#OUTPUT
sum = 55
#OUTPUT
user

I have evaluated your code by executing it in runtime environment via Code.eval_string.

Code evaluation completed without errors and warnings!
Example evaluation completed without errors and warnings! Excellent!
Execution output of example code is, as provided by Code.eval_string:
{55, [sum: 55, number: 10]}
vs the expected result: sum = 55
