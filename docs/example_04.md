#POSSIBLE_ISSUES
1. The calc_sum/1 function might be having an issue with its input or calculation.
2. The function might not be handling exceptions or edge cases properly.
3. There might be an issue in the anonymous function in the sum/1 function.
#POSSIBLE_ISSUES

#POSSIBLE_SOLUTIONS
1. Check the calc_sum/1 function and make sure the operation is being performed correctly.
2. Make sure all inputs to calc_sum/1 are valid and any exceptions are properly handled.
3. Check the anonymous function within sum/1 and ensure it's working properly. Look for any misbehaving code within this function that might be causing the RuntimeError.
#POSSIBLE_SOLUTIONS

#TEST
1. Run different sets of inputs for the problematic functions and see if the error persists.
2. Write unit tests that cover various scenarios for the function and ensure they all pass.
3. Depending on the fix applied, monitor the log files or perform integration testing to ensure the fix is successful.

#STATE FIX #STATE
My application has encountered the following error:
On May 4, 2024 22:15:16.207 GMT in file lib/open_elixir_intelligence/example_system/math.ex on line 18
Description:
The error is a RuntimeError that's being raised from the calc_sum/1 function in the OpenElixirIntelligence.ExampleSystem.Math module.

what's the issue? list all options. choose the best one and then fix following the below guidelines:
1. expose the fixed logic as a public function that can be tested from outside the module
2. make sure the public function can be executed without OTP, task async, agent, etc from iex
3. it shall be possible to hotreload the original code and it should work

As far as I can see from provided module, there are a few potential issues:

1. Handling Errors: Currently, the program raises an error whenever the function `calc_sum` with an argument of 13 is called. You could consider changing it to return a tuple with `:error` at the place of raising an error.

2. Blockers on Special Inputs: The `calc_sum` function can process all numbers but 13. Depending on the scenario, this could be an intentional error handling or it could be blocking correct operations for this special input. If `calc_sum(13)` should yield a valid result instead of an error, you have to fix the function.

Let's assume, the second issue is the one we should target.

You can resolve this issue by defining the function `calc_sum/1` for your special case as follows:

Remember, you should test the `calc_sum` function in isolation to make sure it works correctly without raising an error for the critical scenario.

#CODE
defmodule LlmEvaluator.ExampleSystem.Math do
def child_spec(_),
do: Supervisor.child_spec(Task.Supervisor.child_spec(name: __MODULE__), id: __MODULE__)

def sum(number) do
caller = self()

with {:ok, pid} <-
Task.Supervisor.start_child(
__MODULE__,
fn -> send(caller, {:sum, self(), calc_sum(number)}) end
) do
Process.monitor(pid)
{:ok, pid}
end
end

def calc_sum(n) when n == 13, do: calc_sum(1, n, 0)
def calc_sum(n) when is_integer(n) and n>=0, do: calc_sum(1, n, 0)
def calc_sum(_), do: {:error, "argument must be a positive integer"}

defp calc_sum(from, from, sum), do: sum + from
defp calc_sum(from, to, acc_sum), do: calc_sum(from + 1, to, acc_sum + from)
end
#CODE

Testing this publicly exposed function:

#EXAMPLE
result_13 = LlmEvaluator.ExampleSystem.Math.calc_sum(13)
IO.inspect(result_13)

result_5 = LlmEvaluator.ExampleSystem.Math.calc_sum(5)
IO.inspect(result_5)

result_error = LlmEvaluator.ExampleSystem.Math.calc_sum(-1)
IO.inspect(result_error)
#EXAMPLE

Output should be:

#OUTPUT
result_13 = 91
result_5 = 15
result_error = {:error, "argument must be a positive integer"}
#OUTPUT
user

I have evaluated your code by executing it in runtime environment via Code.eval_string.

Code evaluation completed without errors and warnings!
Example evaluation completed without errors and warnings! Excellent!
Execution output of example code is, as provided by Code.eval_string:
{{:error, "argument must be a positive integer"}, [result_error: {:error, "argument must be a positive integer"}, result_5: 15, result_13: 91]}
vs the expected result: result_13 = 91
result_5 = 15
result_error = {:error, "argument must be a positive integer"}

#WORKING_CODE
#DESCRIPTION
The issue with the calc_sum function raising an error when the argument is 13 is resolved by defining a guard clause for when argument is 13 to use the general calculation flow of positive integers. Also, added guard clause to assure only positive integers are processed, others will simply get an error tuple. The public function `calc_sum` can now be tested in isolation. Testing this function shows it to be correctly calculating the sum for 13 or any other positive integer, while returning error tuple for invalid arguments.
